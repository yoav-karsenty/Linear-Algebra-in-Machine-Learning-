# Linear Algebra in Machine Learning:

The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning. I am asked to evaluate that possibility.

1. Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.
2. Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a prediction model do better than a dummy model?
3. Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.
4. Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.
